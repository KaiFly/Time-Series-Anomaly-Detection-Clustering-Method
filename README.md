# Abnormal_TS_CMC2020
Abnormal detection based on time series clustering approach
Problem : Using machine learning and statistic model to detect abnormal and cheating eletrical consumer in Da Nang Viet Nam.

Data : Time series of electric usage of residents in Da Nang Viet Nam. Each sample is also labeled as abnormal or normal (cheater/normal).

The data quality, labeling, imbalancing handling, big data problems : extracting, transforming, storaging considered to get best input for problem
Implementation : Project has implements some state-of-art approachs using clustering techniques for time series data. The key is feature selection and model optimization steps. The DBSCAN algorithm is chosen because of the fitting to problem, also best metric performance in simulation and reality.

Documents : Research paper and result presentation attached for further improvement
