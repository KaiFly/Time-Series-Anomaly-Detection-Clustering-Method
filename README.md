# Project Name: Abnormal_TS_CMC2020

## 1. Project description: Abnormal detection based on time series clustering approach
### Problem:  Machine Learning and Statistical Model to detect Consumers being cheated in Da Nang Viet Nam.

### Data: Time series of electric usage of residents in Da Nang Viet Nam. Each sample is also labeled as abnormal or normal (cheater/normal).

## 2. Methodology:

### Time Series Preprocessing: Ensure Data quality, Data Labeled, Imbalancing handling, Non-stationary transformation 
### Big Data Techniques:  Extracting, Transforming, Storaging considered to get useful data for model
### Modeling : Project has implements some state-of-art approachs using clustering techniques for time series data. The key is feature selection and model optimization steps. The DBSCAN algorithm is chosen because of the fitting to problem, also best metric performance in simulation and reality.

## 3. Documents : Research paper and result presentation attached for further improvement
